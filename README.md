With the help of this project you can easily perform some basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division on fractions.
You just need to create an object of this class, like this
x=fration(Enter numerator, Enter denominator)
y=fration(Enter numerator, Enter denominator)
and then you can print (x+y), (x-y), (x*y) and (x/y)
